 ------------------
 ====== NEXT ======
 ------------------
 
 - Implement purchase functionality in RemoveAdsView
 
 - BuyView() needs error handling in the event that AppDelegate can't load the items from the app store when declaring products.items[0]
 
 
 - Ensure that purchases write the status of the purchase to user defaults
 
 - Ensure that restorePurchases saves the paid status to userDefaults 
 
 - Link up my app and admob

 
 
 ----------------------------------
 ===== Things for later =====
 ----------------------------------
 
 - Animation issue when moving an item one spot above
 
 - Increase active area textfields
 
 - Customise the return button so the keyboard isn't dismissed
 
 - Swipe down to dismiss keyboard (without breaking other functions. See stackoverflow question I asked)
