 - Make privacy policy for Simple List and upload it using MediaFire
 https://www.mediafire.com/
 
 - Make pro version with darkmode and without ads
 Release the pro version first as it doesn't involve creating the ads as well.
 Look into what clauses need to be added into the privacy policy due to including ads.

 ===== Things for later =====
 ----------------------------------
 
 - Animation issue when moving an item one spot above
 
 - Increase active area textfields
 
 - Customise the return button so the keyboard isn't dismissed
 
 - Swipe down to dismiss keyboard (without breaking other functions. See stackoverflow question I asked)
