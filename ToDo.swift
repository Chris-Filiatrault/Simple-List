 - Error handling anywhere that calls products.items[0], in the event that AppDelegate can't load the items from the app store
 
 - Find a way to instantly remove ads once a purchase is made
 
 - Make the buy view look much nicer. Do some research on what makes users most likely to make the purchase.

 ----------------------------------
 
 - Fix glitchy textfield when typing in Japanese
 
 - Create more localised Display Names for the in-app purchase on App Store Connect
 
 - Try and provide users a confirmation alert when purchases are restored using the built in methods from store-kit, otherwise do it your self (not preferred)
 
 - Animation issue when moving an item one spot above
 
 - Increase active area textfields
 
 - Customise the return button so the keyboard isn't dismissed
 
 - Swipe down to dismiss keyboard (without breaking other functions. See stackoverflow question I asked)
