 - Find a way to instantly remove ads once a purchase is made
 
 - Do some research on what makes users most likely to make the purchase.
 
 - Make sure ads view is removed when the textfield is active

 - Final checks to ensure in-app purchases are working
 
 - Create more localised Display Names for the in-app purchase on App Store Connect
