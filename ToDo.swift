 - Create the final in-app purchase item on the app store
 - Find a way to instantly remove ads once a purchase is made

 - Provide users a confirmation alert when purchases are restored and instantly remove ads
 - BuyView() needs error handling in the event that AppDelegate can't load the items from the app store when declaring products.items[0]
